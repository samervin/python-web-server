title: Adding The Long Night to Dead of Winter
---

This is the story of how I first fell in love with _Dead of Winter_, how _The Long Night_ caused both games to fall out of favor, and what I did to make both games fun again.

### My experience with _Dead of Winter_ and _The Long Night_

I first played [_Dead of Winter_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150376/dead-winter-crossroads-game) around the winter of 2014-2015. One of my coworkers had brought it to a board game night, and we gave it a shot. It was a huge hit. There were lots of possible things to do, randomness that you could usually factor into your decisions, and enough mystery in secret and betrayal objectives that told a great story. It made a return at several board game nights.

It wasn't without its flaws. Playing with a large group meant that downtime between your turns was significant. The rulebook and the player sheets and the cards all seemed to have different parts of the rules. It was hard to keep all the rules in your head. There were a couple of ways for the betrayer to screw everyone else over without too much trouble &mdash; though we did find out we weren't playing with correct movement rules after the first few games. Like I said, the rules aren't the best.

Fast forward a couple years. I'd bought my own copy and had taught a few more people to play. We were playing by the correct rules now and understanding the game a bit better.

Then [_The Long Night_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193037/dead-winter-long-night) was released. A new base game? All new cards and three new expansion modules? Sign me up! We soon picked it up and started playing.

_The Long Night_, aside from introducing more card variety, also includes three expansions: Improvements, Bandits, and Raxxon. Improvements are passive colony abilities that you can discard junk cards to build. Bandits can spawn every round and steal cards from locations. Raxxon features powerful special zombies but also powerful weapon and item cards to find.

So all these changes felt great. _The Long Night_ includes some special main objective cards that slowly introduce the expansions in a developing story. You can also just pick a set of expansions and throw them all on the table. We played many times with Raxxon, the most different and most interesting of the expansions, and sometimes included the Bandits and improvements.

However. A couple things happened that prevented either the original _Dead of Winter_ or _The Long Night_ from making it to the table.

__First__: _The Long Night_'s expansions are neat, but not as balanced as the parts of the base game.

- The improvements are either useless or must-build items. This is a cooperative game, and the improvements apply to everyone, but this still feels weird.
- The bandits do three things: they make a hard game harder (good for some people), they give any exiled characters some extra possible actions to take (not a bad idea), and they increase upkeep at the end of every round as you move the stands around (very bad).
- Raxxon is very polarizing. If someone controls the survivor Blue, who can search quickly through Raxxon's item deck without being in danger, then that player will be the savior of the group. The items from Raxxon are ridiculously good. However, if no one controls Blue, or if the special zombies get a head start on you in the early game, you'll get eaten alive. Many of the special zombies will kill the character that kills them on a bad die roll, which feels bad every time.

__Second__: _The Long Night_ has worse set up. There are more decks of cards to shuffle. You have to either shuffle in or sort out cards from the expansions. There's actually fewer survivor cards than in _Dead of Winter_ &mdash; exactly enough for a 5-player game &mdash; so you see the same survivors more often.

Both of these reasons, along with my own dwindling free time, caused both games to sit on my shelf unplayed for months. In fact, I definitely haven't played either game in 2018 (as of August 19th).

I wanted to fix this, though.

### Finding the best combination of both games

I sat down and laid out all the components from both games side-by-side. Every deck of cards available, every pile of tokens or standees grouped.

I did some simple comparisons. What were the differences in the piles: were the main objectives different? Did the character abilities only make sense in one game or the other? Could I maintain the card variety as in each game?

I also did some thinking. What were the worst parts of setting the game up? Which bags needed to be emptied, and which ones could be drawn from ad hoc?

I think I came up with a valid answer for each of these questions and created a solution to address as many problems as I could. Here's how I considered each individual part.

- I kept the Colony board from the original _Dead of Winter_. The snowy image feels more appropriate than the [prison image](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4003434/dead-winter-long-night) in _The Long Night_.

- I kept the location boards from _The Long Night_. They're as thick as the colony board instead of being thin like the player aid sheets. I also kept the Graveyard board as a nice way to gather removed characters and items.

- I separated out all the cards from _The Long Night_ that were specific to one of the three modules: improvements, bandits, or Raxxon. This mostly consists of the location itself and any associated decks of cards, but also removed two characters (sorry, Blue) and a few crossroads and objective cards. I left these out of all subsequent piles.

- I replaced all the Fuel cards in the starter item deck from _Dead of Winter_ with the Fuel Or Fire cards from _The Long Night_. They're more flexible, which I think is good for the game. I also did this with the six regular location decks, which I'll talk about below.

- I shuffled both decks of survivors, crisis, crossroads, main objectives, secret objectives, betrayer objectives, and exiled objectives together. This is, of course, after I took out the module-specific cards. Some crisis and objective cards are very similar between games, but this isn't a huge deal, and I like the extra variety. Easy enough.

- I kept half of the regular zombie standees from _Dead of Winter_ and half of the zombies from _The Long Night_. I of course kept all the survivor standees too.

- I kept all the tokens from _The Long Night_, since it introduced some new ones: explosive traps, despair, and unruly survivors. I also kept most of the tokens from _Dead of Winter_ that didn't change: food, wound, starvation, and noise tokens. Those four are usually the ones we're looking for in a pinch, so I wanted them to be easier to find.

- I kept one set of trackers (morale, round number, first player), all the small blue dice, and both exposure dice. Keeping the extra dice is mostly for the sake of convenience on large tables.

- Then I had to figure out the six location decks. I knew I wanted to maintain the ratios of card types as printed on the location board. I didn't want to make any piles bigger if I could help it, because some main and secret objectives require you to search through an entire pile. I also wanted to increase variety as much as I could. This was easier for some locations than others. Here's a short explanation of how I did it:
    - I always replaced Fuel with Fuel Or Fire cards from _The Long Night_ (as mentioned above).
    - I replaced most of the Junk cards. Replacing them increased variety at the expense of one of the worst cards to find in a search. Junk is in the starting card deck anyway, so it's no big loss.
    - Police Station: Junk left in place of Shiv, a one-time use weapon. One of the three Pistols and the duplicate Sniper Rifle left in favor of a Grenade Launcher and Assault Rifle from _The Long Night_.
    - Grocery Store: Funny enough, the proportion of card types in _The Long Night_ is wrong in the grocery store. In the original game, there are 6 Food, 6 Medicine, 5 Tool, and 3 Outsiders cards, which matches the location board. In _The Long Night_, there are 8 Food, 4 Medicine, 5 Tool, and 3 Outsider cards, which flips the Medicine and Tool proportions. I didn't like that so I split the difference: I kept 7 food (added a Food 3), 5 Medicine (dropped one), 5 Tool (dropped Junk for Chainsaw), and 3 Outsiders cards.
    - School: This was hard. I wanted to keep the Football Pads and Drill on top of the Megaphone, Scissors, and Bat from _Dead of Winter_, but I only had one Junk to throw away. To keep 5 Item cards, I needed 5 Book and 5 Food cards to keep the proportions correct. I then had only 5 slots left over, and since I didn't want more Outsiders than Medicine I had to drop an Outsiders card. I think this worked out, though. I picked the five books based on effect variety and usefulness.
    - Library: This was harder. Both Library decks have lots of unique books, though _Dead of Winter_'s are mostly blueprints for the different locations. I ended up picking 7 different books (including only one blueprints card, the Library itself). The Library in both games is wrong about its card proportions too: there are 2 Tool and 3 Outsiders cards in both games. I fixed this by includiung an extra Reading Lamp at the cost of a Survivors card.
    - Hospital: I replaced one of the Adrenaline Shots with Steroids, but otherwise made no changes. The two Hospital decks were nearly identical already.
    - Gas Station: I dropped one of the Switchblades for the Katana. _The Long Night_ switches up the proportions of the card types (within their printed order), but to follow the change I would have needed to introduce the alternate art Food 1 card to my set, so I left that part out.

- Finally, I put everything in labeled bags to speed up set up and tear down, a nontrivial part of my hesitation to break _Dead of Winter_ out anymore. Here's a quick breakdown:
    - Survivor standees in a large bag. I wish there was a better way to do this.
    - Zombie standees in a large bag. Easy to keep in one spot.
    - Blue dice in a bag. Dice are usually only changed between rounds, so having them in one spot is OK.
    - Secret and betrayal objectives in a bag, to shuffle and then put away after the start of the game.
    - Main objective and starter item cards in a bag with the three trackers and the exposure dice. This bag gets emptied to start the game, and any extra cards can be put back.
    - Crisis and survivor cards in a bag together. You need to shuffle both decks and keep the whole things around for the whole game.
    - Crossroads cards in a bag. Same thing.
    - Six location cards in a bag. Same thing: you need to shuffle and place all 120 cards, may as well keep them together.
    - All remaining tokens in a bag. Separating them by type creates too many small bags. This bag is big enough to reach into, too.

All the organized and labeled things went into the _Dead of Winter_ box, leaving the extra tokens, cards, and expansion module-specific bits in _The Long Night_'s box.

### What happens next

Well, I'm not sure. Play the game, I guess.

All the organization I did makes me optimistic about actually getting it to the table before the end of the year. We'll see!

__Update:__ Finally got this to the table in September. The variety was nice, in particular at locations like the Police Station and the Library. The bags worked really well for set up as well as tear down. We also assigned the player to the left of the current player to be the token master, which kept people focused and proved to be the best way to handle food, noise, and wound tokens. I suspect we'll get to play it again before the year is out.
